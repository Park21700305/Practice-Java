# ClassAndObject-java
1. (MySalary.java) 
 Define a class called Salary. An object of this class is used to calculate salaries, 
so it calculates a salary that is a whole number greater than basic salary.
Include methods to set the basic salary to 5000, to increase the salary by 10%, and to decrease the salary by 10%.
Be sure that no method allows the value of the counter to become less than the basic salary.
Also include an accessor method that returns the current salary value, as well as a method that displays the salary on the screen.
Do not define an input method. The only method that can set the basic salary is the one that sets it to 5000.
Write a program to test your class definition.
