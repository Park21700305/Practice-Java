# computeDate-java
practiceBasicOfJava

 Write a program that reads a string from the
keyboard and tests whether it contains a valid date.
Display the date and a message that indicates whether it
is valid. If it is not valid, also display a message
explaining why it is not valid. The input date will have the
format mm/dd/yyyy. A valid month value mm must be
from 1 to 12 (January is 1). The day value dd must be
from 1 to a value that is appropriate for the given month.
September, April, June, and November each have 30
days. February has 28 days except for leap years when
it has 29. The remaining months all have 31 days each.
A leap year is any year that is divisible by 4 but not
divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
