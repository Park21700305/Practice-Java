# TemperatureConvertor-java

 Write a Temperature class that represents temperatures in degrees in bothCelsius and Fahrenheit. 
Use a floating-point number for the temperature and a character for the scale: either 'C' for Celsius or 'F' for Fahrenheit. 
The class should have Four constructors: 
one for the number of degrees, one for the scale, one for both the degrees and the scale, and a default constructor. 
For each of these constructors, assume zero degrees if no value is specified and Celsius if no scale is given. 
Two accessor methods: one to return the temperature in degrees Celsius, the other to return it in degrees Fahrenheit.
Use the formulas from Programming Project 5 of Chapter 3 and round to the nearest tenth of a degree.
Three set methods: one to set the number of degrees, one to set the scale, and one to set both.
Three comparison methods: 
one to test whether two temperatures are equal, one to test whether one temperature is greater than another, 
and one to test whether one temperature is less than another.
